An easy table tennis or ping-pong match is simulated in the famous video game Pong. Released in the 1970s, it was one of the first arcade games. Pong is a video game where two players control paddles on opposing sides of the screen with the goal of passing a ball back and forth. In the event that one player fails to return the ball, the game is won by scoring points.
